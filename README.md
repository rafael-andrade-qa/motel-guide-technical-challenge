## Performance Testing Documentation

The detailed documentation for the performance tests using k6 is available in: [Performance Tests with k6 documentation](k6/README.md).

## CI/CD Implementation

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows have been set up to automate test execution. These workflows run automatically to ensure code quality and performance validation.

### UI & API Tests

The **E2E Test Workflow** runs end-to-end tests for UI and API, ensuring the system functions as expected in an integrated environment.  
🔗 [View Workflow Run](https://github.com/rafael-andrade-qa/motel-guide-technical-challenge/actions/runs/13216944628)

### Performance Tests

The **Load Test Workflow** executes performance tests to evaluate the system's scalability and response times under load conditions.  
🔗 [View Workflow Run](https://github.com/rafael-andrade-qa/motel-guide-technical-challenge/actions/runs/13217913834)

These workflows are triggered automatically on new commits and pull requests, ensuring continuous validation and reliability of the application.

## Test Results

The test results are available in the `results` folder.

### File Descriptions:

- **API Tests** (`api-tests/`): API test results in HTML and JSON formats.
- **Load Tests** (`load-tests/`): Load test results in JSON and PNG format.
